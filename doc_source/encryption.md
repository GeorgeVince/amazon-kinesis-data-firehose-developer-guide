# Using Server\-Side Encryption with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose<a name="encryption"></a>

If you have sensitive data, you can enable server\-side data encryption when you use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose\. But you can only do this if you use a Kinesis data stream as your data source\. When you configure a Kinesis data stream as the data source of a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, Kinesis Data Firehose no longer stores the data at rest\. Instead, the data is stored in the data stream\. 

When you send data from your data producers to your Kinesis data stream, Kinesis Data Streams encrypts your data using an AWS KMS key before storing it at rest\. When your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream reads the data from your Kinesis stream, Kinesis Data Streams first decrypts the data and then sends it to Kinesis Data Firehose\. Kinesis Data Firehose buffers the data in memory based on the buffering hints that you specify\. It then delivers it to your destinations without storing the unencrypted data at rest\.

For information about how to enable server\-side encryption for Kinesis Data Streams, see [Using Server\-Side Encryption](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/server-side-encryption.html)\.
